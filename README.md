In this project, a multiple linear regression model is created to predict the audience scores for various movies released in 2016. The data and various attributes were acquired from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb.
The model was built using a dataset of 651 movies released in 2016. The dataset includes the following attributes: IMDB Rating, Genre, Runtime and Rotten Tomatoes Critic Score.

Overall, the model seems to do a decent job of predicting audience scores from variables such as IMDb rating, genre, runtime, and critic score. However, a recent iteration may have violated the constant variance condition, so more improvements need to be made.
