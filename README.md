In this project, a multiple linear regression model is created to predict the audience scores
for various movies from 2016 (the year in which the dataset of movies is based on.) The data and various attributes were acquired from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB.

Overall, the model seems to do a decent job of predicting the audience score from variables such as the IMDB rating, genre, and critic score. More improvements to the model need to be
made, however, as a recent interation seems to have violated the constant variance requirement.
