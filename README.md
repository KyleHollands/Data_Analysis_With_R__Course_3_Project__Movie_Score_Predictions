In this project, a multiple linear regression model is created to predict the audience scores
for various movies from 2016 (the year in which the dataset of movies is based on.) The data and various attributes were acquired from Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB.

Overall, the model seems to do a decent job of predicting the audience score using Rotten Tomatoes'
audience scores as a comparison.
